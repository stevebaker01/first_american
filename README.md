# Steve Baker - 650 995-3501

I have created a service using FastAPI based upon the user story and a suite of 19 tests to run against it.

git clone 


The given user story is somewhat ambiguous which I assume is part of the exercise.
(Please see included "TakeHome_TechnicalExercise.docx")

> A name matching service is to be built that matches the
Buyer names with Owner names.
>This service extracts up to first 4 characters of the last
name from File A (Buyer) to File B (Owners). 
> If there is a match, the flag is IsNameMatched is set to
true.

The second sentence is a little strange. I am making an assumption that is should say

>This service compares up to first 4 characters of the last
name from File A (Buyer) to up to the first four characters from File B (Owners).
